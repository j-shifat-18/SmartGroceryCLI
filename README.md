# SmartGroceryCLI

Smart Grocery CLI is an offline, command-line based grocery management application designed to simplify inventory operations for small grocery shops. The system provides product management, user accounts, checkout functionality, recommendations, and analytics — all through a clean and structured CLI interface.

This project replaces traditional manual stock-keeping and paper-based purchase tracking with a digital file-based solution. Through a modular Java OOP architecture, the system ensures organized data management, easy product handling, secure authentication, and automated billing. Since the system is fully offline and uses file storage, it is suitable for small stores that do not rely on internet-based applications.
